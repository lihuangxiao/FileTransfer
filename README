The program implements file transering between hosts.

to run the program:
Step1: start the server by entering: "./Server.sh"
Step2: note the IP address and port number are now showing on Server
       now Client can send request by entering:
       "./Client.sh get ServerIP ServerPort localFileName remoteFileName" or
       "./Client.sh put ServerIP ServerPort reomteFileName localFileName"
Step3: Client now exits and Server goes back to stage1, waiting for new Clients.

Note:
1, for both client and server, home directory is assumed to be the current directory.

2, for get request, for Client
   if the LocalFile does not exist on Client, create new file and proceed
   if the LocalFile already exists on Client, incoming data is appended to the existing file.

3, Because server selects a random available port, it is important that when we run client, we input the correct port number on which server is listening.
